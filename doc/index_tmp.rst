Usage
==========

Simplest use
------------

This package contains several `launch` files, but `openni.launch` serves as a single point of entry. It can be started by::

  roslaunch openni2_launch openni.launch

Note that with this command the camera driver only accesses a single device. So run as many launch files as needed with correct arguments if you're running multiple devices.

Options/arguments
------------------

`openni.launch` takes the following options.

 * `device_id`: can have the following formats:

   * `#1`  : the first device found

   * `2@X` : the Xth device on USB bus 2.

   E.g. When 2 openni2-based cameras are connected and `lsusb -t` returns the following, where Dev 18 and 19 are the cameras, `device_id` can be `3@18` and `3@19`::

    $ lsusb -t
    /:  Bus 03.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/14p, 480M
        |__ Port 2: Dev 18, If 0, Class=Vendor Specific Class, Driver=usbfs, 480M
        |__ Port 2: Dev 18, If 1, Class=Audio, Driver=, 480M
        |__ Port 2: Dev 18, If 2, Class=Audio, Driver=, 480M
        |__ Port 3: Dev 15, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M
        |__ Port 3: Dev 15, If 1, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M
        |__ Port 6: Dev 19, If 0, Class=Vendor Specific Class, Driver=usbfs, 480M
        |__ Port 6: Dev 19, If 1, Class=Audio, Driver=, 480M
        |__ Port 6: Dev 19, If 2, Class=Audio, Driver=, 480M
